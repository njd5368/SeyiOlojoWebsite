I'm a PhD student (she/her) in the UC Berkeley [School of Information](https://www.ischool.berkeley.edu/) where I am advised by
[Dr. Jenna Burrell](https://sites.ischool.berkeley.edu/jburrell/) and [Dr. Niloufar Salehi](http://niloufar.org/). I'm broadly
interested in stratification within sociotechnical systems and in investigating the role of alternative epistemological paradigms 
in imagining safer and more humane data practices. **My research currently focuses on how the personal data economy, specifically 
online-behavioral targeting, impacts identity formation and the quality of life for individuals with stigmatized health identities.** 
I use a mixed methods approach, which for me, is in service of my goal of turning theory into practice. Previously, I worked as a 
technologist within the AdTech industry. I graduated with a bachelor's degree in Environmental Policy from Barnard College in 2018.

At Berkeley, I am affiliated with the [Algorithmic Fairness and Opacity Group](https://afog.berkeley.edu/), 
the [Center for Technology, Policy and Society](https://ctsp.berkeley.edu/) and the 
[Center for Science, Technology, Medicine & Society](https://cstms.berkeley.edu/research/sts/). My research is generously being 
supported by the Eugene Cota-Robles Fellowship and [the Center For Long-Term Cybersecurity](https://cltc.berkeley.edu/).
